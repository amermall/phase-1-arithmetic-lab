// Write your code here

// Create a variable called multiply set to an equation that will multiply the variables num1 and num2; the result of the multiplication should be 62
let num1 = 31;
let num2 = 2;
const multiply = num1 * num2;

// Create a variable called random that will generate a random integer greater than 0
// -- math.random() - This method generates a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive):
const random = Math.floor((Math.random() * 10));

// Create a variable called mod set to an equation that will calculate the remainder of dividing variable num3 by num4; the remainder should be 4.
let num3 = 24;
let num4 = 5;
const mod = num3 % num4;

// Create a variable called max that finds the highest number in a set; the value returned should be 20
const max = Math.max(5, 10, 15, 20);
